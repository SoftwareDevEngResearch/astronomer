outline for project

script for reading serpent output -- main output file and detector files
script for reading star output
script for checking for errors in output(s)?
script for processing data -- is this separate from reading scripts?
script to run all of the scripts in the package -- can take inputs
input file (yaml?) so the program can be run from command line


brainstorm:
- constelation must gather the data from both simulations, right? can I just use that, since its already in a format python likes? does constelation handle the final outputs, or just intermediate steps?
- can force star to output csv files. are there other file formats available? hdf5 maybe?
- detector outputs should be easy enough to read, but they are matlab files, so Im not sure how best to merge with python
- do I need to make sure the data processing package runs python 2.7 so it can run on the cluster? running on the cluster would be nice
- serpent output files are big and nasty. Im not sure how final outputs are reported with multi-processor sims.
- I can practice with failed sims that have outputs. Should have 2 that each failed in a different way.
- do I need to run a steady state serpent sim to get final reactivity? I could compare to initial steady run. Or is the k value from the transient sim good enough?
- input file will need to include file names and paths for data outputs from simulations.

to do:
- determine data points to plot / collect from outputs (density, pressure, temp, etc)
- write scripts to collect correct data and generate plots
- find out how to get final reactivity and reactivity change over time from serpent
- use hdf5 to format data all into one place (maybe all of the data, then just plot selected data?)
- make sure to write scripts and programs in python 2.7. need to install onto computers for testing
