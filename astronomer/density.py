# this is a script/function to process the density data
# will need inputs of file paths to use -- this should be based on constelation

# need to read in data from csv files located in \LineProbe; \LineProbeBot; and \LineProbeTop
# axial data is denoted as: Line_Probe_Density_Line_Dens_00100.csv
# radial data is denoted as: Radial_Line_Density_RadialDens_00100.csv
# where _00100 at end of file name is time step, increments by 100 in folders
